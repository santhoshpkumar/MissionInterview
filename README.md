## Binary Search Tree
        AVL Trees
        Red-Black Trees

#### Segment tree 
stores intervals, and optimized for "which of these intervals contains a given point" queries.

#### Interval tree 
stores intervals as well, but optimized for "which of these intervals overlap with a given interval" queries. It can also be used for point queries - similar to segment tree.

#### Range tree 
stores points, and optimized for "which points fall within a given interval" queries.

#### Binary indexed or Febwick tree 
stores items-count per index, and optimized for "how many items are there between index m and n" queries.

#### Performance / Space consumption for one dimension:

                Segment tree - O(n logn) preprocessing time, O(k+logn) query time, O(n logn) space
                Interval tree - O(n logn) preprocessing time, O(k+logn) query time, O(n) space
                Range tree - O(n logn) preprocessing time, O(k+logn) query time, O(n) space
                Binary Indexed tree (Fenwick Tree) - O(n logn) preprocessing time, O(logn) query time, O(n) space
